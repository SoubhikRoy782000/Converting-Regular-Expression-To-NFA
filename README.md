# Converting-Regular-Expression-To-NFA

Aim –

To convert Regular Expression to NFA.

Algorithm –

STEP 1 – Create a menu for getting regular expressions input as choice. 
STEP 2 – To draw NFA for a, a/b ,ab ,a* create a routine for each regular expression. 
STEP 3 – For converting from regular expression to NFA, certain transitions had been made based on choice of input at the runtime. 
STEP 4 – Each of the NFA will be displayed in sequential order.
